# Notes App

## Description
This is an app deployed on Heroku that allows the user to write, save, update, and delete notes. The application uses an Express.js back-end and stores notes on a JSON file.

## Usage

You will then be able to enter your note title by clicking on the grey 'Note Title' text, as well as entering the note itself by clicking on the grey 'Note Text'.

Once you have finished composing your note you can click on the save icon in the upper righthand corner. Your new note will appear on the lefthand side of the screen where you can click on it to view the content, or click on the trashcan to delete it.
